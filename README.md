##Usage:
```
xtractb --- extracts verse from the bible.. output in 'database' format

   Usage:
      xtractb -b <book> -c <chapter> -v <verse>
      (or) -b <book>
      (or) -b <book-book>
      (or) -b <book> -c <chapter>
      (or) -b <book> -c <chapter-chapter>
      (or) -b <book> -c <chapter> -v <verse-verse>
      (or) -range <range: nt,ot,entire>
          [-t <translation: niv,nasb,kjv,esv>]

-------
formatb  --- formats output to desired media (ie. text or tex)

   Usage:
      formatb [-o <output format: txt,tex default: txt>] < input_file
            [-g(reek input (tex mode only))]
            [-i(gnore printing the tex macro information (tex mode only))]
            [-p(oetry)] [-n(o numbers for chapter and verses)]
            [-k( highlight in color)]

   Notes:
      -i: does not print the macro information for creating a tex file
          this is useful if combining several files into one
          so you don't have to delete all the tex information
      -p: poetry is used with the tex option to make Psalms look 
          normal (not like prose... each line centered)
      -n: no numbers for chapter and verses doesn't print the numbers for 
          the chapter and verse
      -k: colorizes words on terminals that support the escape
          characters (ansi?)
